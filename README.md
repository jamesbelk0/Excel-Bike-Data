## To prepare this data, the data was cleaned of extra rows and unneeded columns.The following processes were performed:

### Exploratory Data Analysis
    
 - During the exploratory data analysis, two line charts and a bar chart were created to help get a better understanding of the data.
 - Before making any analysis I created a new column for age brackets, changed the marital status from M/S to Married/Single, gender from F/M to Male/Female and created three pivot tables. 
 - These pivot tables tracked the average income by gender, the customer commute, and the age bracket for the customer.

The chart above shows the breakdown of the average income of the customer and if they purchased a bike. 

- The data shows that individuals with more income typically purchase bikes.

The dashboard above allows for manipulate the data to get a more percise look at an individuals lifestyle. These metrics include Marital Status, Region, Education and if the customer owns a car. 

- The data clearly shows the individuals who make over 50,000 and are middle aged are more likely to purchase a bike. These individuals also will live within 2 miles of work overall with roughly 80 customers who purchase a bike if they are more than 5-10 miles away. 

# Business Solution
 - Using the dashboard above I would recommend for a shop to advertise to the middle aged market and in areas where the average income per household is over 45,000.  
 - My recommendation would be to collect this data and compare findings further expanding our knowledge and preventing possible misdiagnosis in the future.
